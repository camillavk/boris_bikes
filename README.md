Boris Bikes
=======================

## Synopsis

For the first project at Makers Academy we were asked to build a simply system for managing Boris Bikes in London.
Our system needs to keep track of a number of docking stations and bikes. It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rent. There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and vans to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.

The goal of this project is to introduce us to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the basics of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

It will also introduce us to Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Technologies Used

Ruby and Rspec
